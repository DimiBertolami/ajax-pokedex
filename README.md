# ajax-pokedex
i know what a pokedex is (is something I would never have said 8 years ago, now because of my kid I love pokemons too especially snorlax)

1. So now everything is retrieved from the API and displayed in a nice table.
2. added refresh button to perform new search.
3. tried to write useful functions to write the least code possible
4. now i'll start on the evolutions.

I learned how to use the following shorthand syntax correctly
it checks which of the two arrays is longest and uses that inside the for loop to include all results
```javascript
    const arrLongest = (abilities.length > moves.length) ? abilities.length : moves.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < arrLongest; i++) {
    }
    ```
