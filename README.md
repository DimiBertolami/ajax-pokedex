# ajax-pokedex
i know what a pokedex is (is something I would never have said 8 years ago, now because of my kid I love pokemons too especially snorlax)

1. So now everything is retrieved from the API and displayed in a nice table.
2. added refresh button to perform new search.
3. tried to write useful functions to write the least code possible
4. now i'll start on the evolutions.
